#### 2406/04 Coriander
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 40gr dried coriander, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h                     |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Simple | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with coriander in boiler. |
| Product  | ~158ml  | 81% |   | Cutoff temp: ~87-88C on BBQ Temp. <br /><br />$\frac{40gr.}{158ml.}=0,25gr/ml$ Coriander|

Nice. Tossed about a teaspoon of heads. Nice and fresh early on, later somewhat darker, herbal, earthy but still nice. After 88C dark, murky bitter, soapy and sharpish. 
Strong dilution (low ABV, say <20%) gives foul tastes after 87-88C in the simple setup.

#### 2406/05 Juniper
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 60gr dried juniper, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 24h                    |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Standard | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with juniper in boiler. |
| Product  | ~180ml  | 87% |   | Cutoff temp: ~85C on BBQ Temp. <br /><br />$\frac{60gr.}{180ml.}=0,33gr/ml$ |

Discarded first 10ml, onset of tails is very gradual. Deeper into tails reminds of coriander tails. Taste changes gradually during distilling, first the lighter, brighter juniper notes come through, later the more medicinal and darker herbal tones come into play. Freshness is gone around 83C.
May have included too much of the herbal notes. 

#### 2406/06 Angelica Seed

|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20 gr dried Angelica seed (grown, harvested and dried by Bert), 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 24h                    |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Standard | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with angelica in boiler. |
| Product  | ~190ml  | 88% |   | Cutoff temp: unknown <br /><br /> $\frac{20gr.}{190ml.}=0,11gr/ml$ Angelica seed. |

Surprising! Almost nothing in the tails department, only at the very last stages of distilling a faint menthol/coffee/chocolate like smell accompanying the more dried gras or hay like boiled green taste and smell. Starts out very fresh with lots of oils, discarded the first 10ml or so that had some funky stuff going on. 
During the run the smell/taste gets thicker, however little additional aroma's are added. sometimes it smells almost fruity. 

#### 2406/07 Orris root

|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20 gr dried orris root, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 24h                    |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Standard | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with root in boiler. |
| Product  | ~210ml  | 88% |   | Cutoff temp: unknown <br /><br /> $\frac{20gr.}{210ml.}=0,10gr/ml$ Orris root |

Tossed first 10ml. First distillate is relatively fresh, after which some more oily and later more medicinal, woody, earthy, darkes tastes and smells come through. tails are very late in the process, they only come over when the alcohol is nearly depleted. No temperature taken, but they are very easily noticeable and start coming over quite suddenly. Very little warning/smearing before they start. 

Strong smell and taste, all in all Very little orris root is needed. 

#### 2406/08 Brasil Pink Pepper

|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20 gr dried Brasil pink pepper, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 24h                    |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Standard | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with pepper in boiler. |
| Product  | ~180ml  | 87% |   | Cutoff temp: unknown, way at the end somewhere. <br /><br /> $\frac{20gr.}{180ml.}=0,11gr/ml$ Pink pepper. |

Tossed first 5ml. Sharp as hell. Followed by beautiful smells. Soft, floral, fruity, peppery, spicy, minty (?). Sourced from local asian shop (Oriental Express NL), description on bottle says sourced from Brasil, so probably [Schinus Terebinthifolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinus_terebinthifolia "Wikipedia: Schinus Terebinthifolia")

Oddly enough, there is a very, very nice but faint minty taste in it. Fresh, or cold, or "numbing" like in sechuan pepper (?).
Very little tails and not very offending. Taste lingers throughout the process, although the fresher tastes and smells prevail in the earlier stages of distilling. As always. More taste in stronger solution, when diluted back to low abv (<20?) the peppery taste dominates.


# Citrus

##  Bitter Orange

#### 2406/01 Bitter orange (1)
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup  | Notes   |
|----------|--------|-----|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h  |
| Distill  | 600ml  | 40% | Simple  | add 200ml water to macerate. Unfiltered - distilled with orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~110ml | 80% |   | Cutoff temp: not measured / probably around 83C. <br /><br />$\frac{20gr.}{110ml.}=0,18gr/ml$ Bitter orange peel  |

Distillation was a first try of the setup, simple distillation with no column or reflux.
I was a bit optimistic in choosing the fractions, unfortunately still a hint of tails but very, very far away. 

#### 2406/02 Bitter Orange (2)
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup  | Notes  |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h   |
| Distill  | 600ml  | 40% | Simple  | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled without! orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~78ml  | 82% |   | Cutoff temp: ~83C on BBQ Temp. Very clean smell/taste.   <br /><br />$\frac{20gr.}{78ml.}=0,26gr/ml$ Bitter orange peel. |

Outside temperature was higher than #1, less reflux. 

#### 2406/03 Bitter Orange (3)
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 200ml  | 96% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 200ml@96% ABV + Macerated 48h                     |
| Distill  | 550ml  | ~35% | Simple  | (add 350ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled without! orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~98ml  | 78% |   | Cutoff temp: ~85C on BBQ Temp. Slightly muf geurtje, less tails and later in process. Is this due to macerating @96% ? <br /><br />$\frac{20gr.}{98ml.}=0,20gr/ml$ Bitter orange peel|
