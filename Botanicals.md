#### 2406/04 Coriander
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 40gr dried coriander, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h                     |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Simple | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with coriander in boiler. |
| Product  | ~158ml  | 81% |   | Cutoff temp: ~87-88C on BBQ Temp.  |

Nice. Tossed about a teaspoon of heads. Nice and fresh early on, later somewhat darker, herbal, earthy but still nice. After 88C dark, murky bitter, soapy and sharpish. 
Strong dilution (low ABV, say <20%) gives foul tastes after 87-88C in the simple setup.

#### 2406/05 Juniper
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup.  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 60gr dried juniper, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 24h                    |
| Distill  | 600ml  | ~40% |  Standard | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled with juniper in boiler. |
| Product  | ~180ml  | 87% |   | Cutoff temp: ~85C on BBQ Temp.  |

Discarded first 10ml, onset of tails is very gradual. Deeper into tails reminds of coriander tails. Taste changes gradually during distilling, first the lighter, brighter juniper notes come through, later the more medicinal and darker herbal tones come into play. Freshness is gone around 83C.
May have included too much of the herbal notes. 

# Citrus

##  Bitter Orange

#### 2406/01 Bitter orange (1)
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup  | Notes                                                                            |

| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h                |
| Distill  | 600ml  | 40% | Simple  | add 200ml water to macerate. Unfiltered - distilled with orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~110ml | 80% |   | Cutoff temp: not measured / probably around 83C.           |

Distillation was a first try of the setup, simple distillation with no column or reflux.
I was a bit optimistic in choosing the fractions, unfortunately still a hint of tails but very, very far away. 

#### 2406/02 Bitter Orange (2)
|          | volume | ABV | Dist. Setup  | Notes                                                                              |
|----------|--------|-----|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h                     |
| Distill  | 600ml  | 40% | Simple  | (add 200ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled without! orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~78ml  | 82% |   | Cutoff temp: ~83C on BBQ Temp. Very clean smell/taste.                                         |

Outside temperature was higher than #1, less reflux. 

#### 2406/03 Bitter Orange (3)

| Macerate | 200ml  | 96% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 200ml@96% ABV + Macerated 48h                     |
| Distill  | 550ml  | ~35% | Simple  | (add 350ml water to macerate) Filtered - distilled without! orange peel in boiler. |
| Product  | ~98ml  | 78% |   | Cutoff temp: ~85C on BBQ Temp. Slightly muf geurtje, less tails and later in process. Is this due to macerating @96% ? |
