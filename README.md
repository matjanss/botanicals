# Botanicals

Notes on distilling botanicals (for ie. gin).

#### Standard operating procedure:
- Macerate 20gr botanicals in 250/150, meaning 250ml neutral alcohol@96% ABV + 150ml water resulting in a 60% ABV ethanol/water mixture.
- Maceerate at room temperature for 24h.
- Dilute with 200-400ml water to get 40-30% ABV macerate.
- Distill with botanicals in boiler.

There are some cases where botanicals have been filtered out (see ie. citrus peel essences, 2604/02-03) or maceration was not done (Carter head/gin basket in stead, flowers etc). 
This is mentioned in the notes. Without mention, botanicals are boiled in the erlenmeyer during distillation.

#### Distillation setup is either: 
- Simple (Erlenmeyer, distilling head but no bridge, liebig slanted at ~25degrees down),
- Standard (Erlenmeyer, glass column ~35cm empty, distilling head, liebig vertical down)
- Packed Light (Erlenmeyer, glass column ~35cm packed with light Polish SPP, liebig vertical)
- Packed Heavy (Erlenmeyer, glass column ~35cm packed with BB Jack SPP, liebig vertical)
