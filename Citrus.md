| Macerate | 400ml  | 60% |   | 20gr dried citrus, 250ml@96% ABV + 150ml water + Macerated 48h                |

| Product  | ~110ml | 80% |   | Cutoff temp: not measured / probably around 83C.           |

Distillation was a first try of the setup, simple distillation with no column or reflux.
I was a bit optimistic in choosing the fractions, unfortunately still a hint of tails but very, very far away.
